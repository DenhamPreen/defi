# DeFi Studies
A series of DeFi related articles, videos and resources.

To truly understand DeFi, one have to understand the basic of the underlying technology. 
I believe that DeFi can truly create a new financial system and along with that, it can allow for businesses models that we didn't know were possible. 

Below I intend to organize a list of articles, videos and resources to guide your DeFi studies.
